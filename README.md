# Physics-Informed Neural Operators for Solar Wind Forecasting

This repository contains the source code and experimental results for the PiNO (Physics-Informed Neural Operator) approach, developed as part of the master thesis titled "Leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Architectures as Solar Wind Forecasting Models".

## Overview

The PiNO approach explores the integration of physics-informed techniques with neural operators for improved solar wind forecasting. Unlike traditional data-driven methods, PiNO models incorporate domain-specific knowledge to enhance prediction accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for implementing the PiNO approach.
- **results/**: Contains visualizations and summaries of experimental results obtained during the study.

## Data

The model uses data derived from magnetogram observations and solar wind parameters processed through the MULTI-VP model. Note that due to data privacy and licensing issues, the dataset used in the study is not publicly available in this repository.
